# ZotMoov
A *simple* plugin for Zotero 7 that mooves attachments and links them.

ZotMoov can automatically move added attachments into the directory of your choosing, or you can opt to manually move and link each file into their own respective directory.

## Installation

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/wileyyugioh/zotmoov/releases)

Note that you have to right click the .xpi and save link as.

To set up with 3rd party syncing services, set the Linked Attachment Base Directory to the synced folder.

Then point ZotMoov to that same folder.

If you want to moove already existing files to the ZotMoov directory, you can right click them and use the appropriate menu item.

You can enable the Collection Subdirectory option for ZotMoov to automatically create and place your file in a folder that corresponds to its collection. **Note that each file is only placed in one directory â€” files in multiple collections will not appear in multiple folders!**
